## Network: What does it do?

As the name suggests, network labels with graph relationship between objects. However, unlike those of NER or dependency trees, network is more suitable for a balanced relationship (as in all objects are from the same class). Therefore one obvious function for network would be to illustrate the social network of the characters in the book[^1], which is what we're doing with *Decline and Fall*.

## Construction

To begin with, we need a sample data like [this one][Gibbon]. This raw xml includes names and relationships (with other names). 

The code will then construct the network node by node (name by name), adding connections (or weights if the connection exists). This part is done via the following code:

```python

    # returns list filled with all names within the file

    def namesList(entrySec):
        persList = []
        for persName in entrySec('persName'):
            if persName.string != None:
            persList.append(persName.string)
            else:
            for surname in persName('surname'):
                persList.append(surname.string)
        return persList

```

Then we can go ahead and visualize the network using tools like matlab/bokeh.

See [this][colab] colab for codes.
