## Mapping Gibbon...

The original version of *Decline and Fall* came without any maps, despite [Gibbon's Extensive use of geographical descriptions][gibbonGeo]. If we were able to append maps (even interactive ones) to a digital copy, things could be much simpler to understand.

While the geographical landscape may have been more or less the same since the Roman empire, mapping is still a challenge when it comes to labeling political entities or artificial creations. This is where [Pelagios Network][Pelagios] comes in.

>The Pelagios Network is a long-running initiative that links information online through common references to places. 

From Pelagios, we can search for Geographical entities in a specific space & time frames, allowing us to filter out modern irrelevant place names while also knowing where and what they are from a modern view when mapping events in *Decline and Fall*. The site can be utilized with python via [this][git] Github package, which can produce data frames that includes names, location and other relevant information (in our case, we can include ). The data frame can then be plotted onto a [customed google map][Gmap].

Hence, we can automate the mapping process!

## Exercise #3

Codes [here][colab].

[This][map] is the map I created using all the locations found in chapter 11. An alternative version made with GIS can be found [here][altmap].

Despite not having a time sequence, this map still was able to provide information of the chapter as it outlined important locations(on google map via color and on GIS via size), determined by the number of times the place was mentioned. When viewed along with the text, the map also aids understanding by providing straightforward information about distances and landscapes between locations (For example, where Aureolus, Gallienus, and Claudius were and went upon the series of events that led to the death of Gallienus). Like topic modeling, the result of this work offers little information on its own, but is a lot more helpful when placed together oth the text.
