## Text Classification

    note: classification = definite grouping, regression = point on spectrum (or dimentions)

Unlike topic modeling, text classification attempts to interpret individual text and their meaning. The specific example explored now is **sentiment analysis** Doing this via code allows one to quickly interpret author's attitudes towards various topics, derived through use of words.

> - - "bag of words" (BOW) models # the one we are using!
> - - support-vector machines
> - - deep learning

>Unsupervised
> - Less common
> - Includes approaches like clustering
> - Does not require labeled training data
>
>Non-machine learning based approaches

>Rule-based
> - Use some heuristic metrics
> - Presence/frequency of pre-defined word collections
> - - Length
> - - Punctuation
> - - Metadata
> - - - Time of publication
> - - - Place of publication
> - - - Age of publisher
> - - - Gender of publisher


Like all previous NLP methods discussed, the classification process is not perfect. Apart from difficulties that is similar to those mention about [NER][ner], other errors caused by a complex language context (for example irony and humor) may have more significant impacts to the results since the process depends more on intra-sentence analysis instead of intra-corpus analysis.
