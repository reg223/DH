Hi, the code I used for both texts is  


    #Words frequency analysis  
    #By Sam Hu, 2021/9/13  
    #Count a given piece of texts's different words and their frequencies  

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    text = """"""
    #text = open("").read() 
    #(use file instead of text)

    #create 2 identical list of words from text & define frequency variable
    wordslist = text.split()
    words = text.split()
    frequency = []
    #create list of all words but only showing once
    words =  (set(wordslist) & set(words))
    words = list(words)
    #count for each word its frequency
    while len(frequency) <= len(words):
        frequency.append(0)
    for i in range (0,len(wordslist)):
        for x in range (0, len(words)):
            if wordslist[i] == words[x]:
                frequency[x]+=1
    frequency.pop()
    #output results as csv file
    data = pd.DataFrame({"Words":pd.Categorical(words),
                    "Frequency": pd.Categorical(frequency)})
    data.to_csv("a.csv")

Which produces a csv file of all words and their frequency in the given text.
